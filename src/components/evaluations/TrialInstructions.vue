            <h5>Evaluating applicants</h5>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                This can be done in any way as long as it emphasizes the main issues of the applicant with examples and explanations, skipping on the smaller issues so the applicant doesn't get overwhelmed. Think of it as a modpost on their modding, in a way.
            </p>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                You should also factor in their level of decision making since this will be the most important aspect of their bn work.
            </p>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                Also, make sure to be formal in your writing and address the applicant directly as your eval will be visible to them and maybe even displayed in the public archive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Evaluating current BNs</h5>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                Judging current BNs relies on resets + activity + map quality. Try not to be too harsh on map quality as we all have different ideas of what "quality" truly means, but do share your thoughts on maps as much as possible, since if 3 or 4 different evaluators find issues in the nominations of a BN, there is likely a problem that needs addressing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Writing feedback</h5>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                This part is mostly redundant now because your individual evaluation is a replacement for what feedbacks used to be. Feel free to have fun with those for current BN evals, but if you are handing out a warning you should quickly summarize general concerns within 3~4 sentences and send them on their way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Group movers</h5>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                The <code>@Group Mover</code> role needs to get pinged when a group move is necessary (or <code>@Hivie</code> if he's online). The group move should coincide with you clicking the <code>Send feedback</code> button on the website!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Things to remember</h5>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                <b>Communicate, communicate, communicate!</b> This means asking questions about anything at any time, talking to your fellow evaluators about evaluations, and talking to us if you lose interest in the event. communication is key in a group environment!
            </p>
            <p class="small ml-4">
                <b>Please don't leak anything!!!</b> We know you probably think this is obvious but it still needs to be said, considering that trust is a major part of being an NAT member.
